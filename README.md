# Python Machine Learning 

This is the culmination of my thesis project, focusing on using machine learning to categorise the type of movement someone is performing on a force plate. 
The thesis paper will soon be finished, which I'll then include here as well.

Please open the FYP folder, open main.py and run that.
You'll be prompted to enter 0 or 1 to choose an algorithm and then just watch the magic.

This project requires using the Anaconda distribution for Pyton 3.6. 
If you want to run the SupportVectorMachine file then it also requires the use of a Mac with Anaconda installed.
